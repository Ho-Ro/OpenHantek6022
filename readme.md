OpenHantek6022 is a free software for Hantek and compatible (Voltcraft/Darkwire/Protek/Acetech) USB digital signal oscilloscopes. 
It was initially developed by [David Gr√§ff and others](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/graphs/contributors) on [github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek). After David [stopped maintaining](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/issues/277) the programm I cloned the repo to provide some updates - but only for Hantek 6022BE/BL on the linux platform.

* Actively supported devices: Hantek 6022BE/BL on Linux.
* Other operating systems builds: MacOSX - partly tested & Windows - untested.
* DSO2xxx Series and DSO52xx Series support is still in but untested due to missing devices.

## Features

* Digital phosphor effect to notice even short spikes.
* Voltage and Spectrum view for all device supported chanels.
* :star: NEW: Show DC (average), AC (rms) and RMS values as well as frequency of displayed channels.
* Math channel with these modes: Ch1+Ch2, Ch1-Ch2, Ch2-Ch1.
* Freely configurable colors.
* Export to CSV, JPG, PNG or print the graphs.
* :star: NEW: Localized CSV file (decimal and data separator).
* Supports hardware and software triggered devices.
* :star: NEW: Trigger modes: Normal, Auto and Single with green/red status display (top left).
* :star: NEW: Shows a red channel warning (bottom left) if input data is clipped.
* A zoom view with a freely selectable range.
* All settings can be saved to a configuration file and loaded again.
* :star: NEW: Calibration values loaded from eeprom or a model configuration file (only 6022BE/BL).
* :star: NEW: [Calibration program](https://github.com/Ho-Ro/Hantek6022API/blob/master/README.md#create-calibration-values-for-openhantek) to create these values automatically.
* Multiple instances with a different device each can be started.
* The dock views on the main window can be customized by dragging them around and stacking them.
  This allows a minimum window size of 640*480 for old workstation computers.

## Install prebuilt binary
* Get Linux (and untested MacOSX and Win) packages from the [Releases](https://github.com/Ho-Ro/OpenHantek6022/releases) page.
* Get MacOSX package from [macports](https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=openhantek) - thx [ra1nb0w](https://github.com/ra1nb0w).
* [Download (untested) Windows build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Ho-Ro/openhantek/branch/master/artifacts).


## Building OpenHantek6022 from source
You need the following software, to build OpenHantek6022 from source:
* [CMake 3.5+](https://cmake.org/download/)
* [Qt 5.4+](https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/)
* [FFTW 3+ (prebuild files will be downloaded on windows)](http://www.fftw.org/)
* libusb 1.x (prebuild files will be used on windows)
* A compiler that supports C++11 - tested with gcc, clang and msvc.

We have build instructions available for [Linux](docs/build.md#linux), [Apple MacOSX](docs/build.md#apple) and [Microsoft Windows](docs/build.md#windows).

## Run OpenHantek6022
With the original OpenHantek version you needed an OpenGL 3.2+ or OpenGL ES 2.0+ capable graphics hardware.
OpenHantek6022 runs now on legacy HW/SW (OpenGL 2.1+ or OpenGL ES 1.2+) with the patch [coozoo@01b42d3](https://github.com/coozoo/openhantek/commit/01b42d3db2921a0aa83ea6808147ea6257de3f28")
OpenGL is preferred, if available. Overwrite this behaviour by starting OpenHantek6022
from the command line like this: `OpenHantek --useGLES`.

USB access for the device is required:
* As seen on the [Microsoft Windows build instructions](docs/build.md#windows) page, you need a
special driver for Windows systems.
* On Linux, you need to copy the file `firmware/60-hantek.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` or `/lib/udev/rules.d/` and replug your device.

## Specifications, Features and limitations
Please refer to the [Specifications, Features, Limitations](docs/limitations.md) page.

## Contribute
We welcome any reported Github Issue if you have a problem with this software. Send us a pull request for enhancements and fixes. Some random notes:
   - Read [how to properly contribute to open source projects on GitHub][10].
   - Create a separate branch other than *master* for your changes. It is not possible to directly commit to master on this repository.
   - Write [good commit messages][11].
   - Use the same [coding style and spacing][13]
     (install clang-format. Use make target: `make format` or execute directly from the openhantek directory: `clang-format -style=file src/*`).
   - Open a [pull request][12] with a clear title and description.
   - Read [Add a new device](docs/adddevice.md) if you want to know how to add a device.
   - We recommend QtCreator as IDE on all platforms. It comes with CMake support, a decent compiler, and Qt out of the box.
